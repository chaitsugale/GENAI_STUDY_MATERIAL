RAG has only\\nbeen trained and explored with a Wikipedia-\\nbased external knowledge base and is not\\noptimized for use in other specialized do-\\nmains such as healthcare and news. In this\\npaper, we evaluate the impact of joint train-\\ning of the retriever and generator compo-\\nnents of RAG for the task of domain adap-\\ntation in ODQA. We propose RAG-end2end ,\\nan extension to RAG, that can adapt to a\\ndomain-speciﬁc knowledge base by updat-\\ning all components of the external knowl-\\nedge base during training. In addition, we\\nintroduce an auxiliary training signal to in-\\nject more domain-speciﬁc knowledge. This\\nauxiliary signal forces RAG-end2end to re-\\nconstruct a given sentence by accessing the\\nrelevant information from the external knowl-\\nedge base.

Our work has been open-sourced\\nthrough the Huggingface Transformers li-\\nbrary, attesting to our work’s credibility and\\ntechnical consistency.1\\n1 Introduction\\nOpen Domain Question Answering (ODQA) (Lee\\net al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020c) is an important\\n1This paper is awaiting publication at TACL and this is a\\npre-MIT Press publication versiontask in natural language understanding. ODQA\\nmethods generally feature a two-stage pipeline: a\\nretriever that selects passages relevant to a given\\nquestion and a reader that generates the answers\\nfrom selected passages. Conventionally, these two\\ncomponents are trained separately using ground\\ntruth context passages relevant to question-answer\\n(QA) pairs. However, for many real-world scenar-\\nios, it is hard to ﬁnd explicitly annotated context-\\nquestion-answer triplets (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis\\net al., 2020b; Guu et al., 2020).\\nRecently, Retrieval Augmented Models (RAGs)\\nhave drawn considerable attention from researchers.\\nRAG consists of a state-of-the-art-neural retriever\\ncalled Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) (Karpukhin\\net al., 2020) and BART seq2seq language\\nmodel (Lewis et al., 2020a). Compared to the\\nconventional two-staged ODQA pipelines, RAG\\nmerges the retriever and reader stages into one\\narchitecture. Moreover, unlike expensive lan-\\nguage models with billions of parameters (e.g.,\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Megatrone-\\nLM (Narayanan et al., 2021)) where the model’s\\nparametric memory represents the complete knowl-\\nedge, RAG can also extract knowledge from an ex-\\nternal knowledge base. Using both parametric and\\nnon-parametric memory generally leads to reduced\\nhallucinations and higher interpretability in tasks\\nlike question answering and summarization (Xu\\net al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2021; Guu et al., 2020;\\nLewis et al., 2020b).\\nIn this work, we focus on exploring retrieval\\naugmented architectures for the task of domain-\\nspeciﬁc open-domain question answering. Al-\\nthough there are several similar retrieval augmented\\narchitectures, such as REALM (Guu et al., 2020)\\nand RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2021), we used Re-arXiv:2210.02627v1  [cs.CL]  6 Oct 2022'),\n",

This is because re-encoding the\\nexternal knowledge base is computationally ex-\\npensive and relies on a sophisticated implementa-\\ntion. Despite not ﬁnetuning the passage encodings,\\nthe RAG model performs well for datasets with\\nWikipedia-like knowledge bases because the DPR\\nretriever components have already been trained\\non Wikipedia-based datasets (Kwiatkowski et al.,\\n2019; Joshi et al., 2017). However, the feasibility\\nof adapting RAG to speciﬁc ODQA domains such\\nas research papers and news is not well understood.\\nThis is a critical research gap to address, as im-\\nproved domain adaptation can further improve the\\nODQA performance of RAG.\\nThis paper explores the feasibility of using RAG\\nin specialized domains for ODQA. In particular,\\nwe propose two modiﬁcations to the original RAG\\nto improve its domain adaptability. Motivated\\nby recent end2end retrieval augmented mecha-\\nnisms (Guu et al., 2020; Sachan et al., 2021; Singh\\net al., 2021), we ﬁrst propose a method to ﬁne-\\ntune the RAG model with its neural retriever and\\nupdate its knowledge encodings asynchronously\\nduring training. We refer to this as RAG-end2end\\nsince it allows us to update all RAG components\\nduring training, including the external knowledge\\nbase, the DPR model, and the BART model. Sec-\\nondly, we propose an auxiliary training signal to\\nhelp our model learn more domain-speciﬁc knowl-\\nedge. This took the form of generating a concise\\nand factual statement about a document using a\\nself-retrieved set of passages from the provided\\ndomain-speciﬁc knowledge base. These two mod-\\niﬁcations offer a unique feature to RAG-end2end\\nover RAG: joint training of the retriever and gen-\\nerator for the end QA task and domain adaptation.\\nAlthough asynchronous updates to the knowledge\\nencoder have been proposed before in the REALM,\\nprevious work has not evaluated the effects of joint\\ntraining of the RAG’s retriever and the generator\\nfor the domain adaptation in ODQA.\\nWe evaluate our proposed approach on three dif-\\nferent datasets from three domains: COVID-19\\nresearch (Wang et al., 2020), Conversations (Wu\\net al., 2021b), and News (Trischler et al., 2016).The major ﬁnding of our work is that the adap-\\ntation of the retriever component plays a critical\\nrole in overall domain adaptation performance in\\nRAG-like architectures. Updating only the ques-\\ntion encoder without updating the knowledge base\\nencoding could degrade performance. Instead of\\nﬁnetuning the DPR retriever separately, our ex-\\nperiments show that ﬁnetuning it as a part of the\\nRAG-end2end mechanism gives better overall re-\\nsults. Our results also show that using the auxiliary\\nsignal improves both the retriever component and\\nthe overall accuracy.\\nIn addition, we open-source the implementation\\nofRAG-end2end with the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners (Wolf et al., 2019) Library2providing the oppor-\\ntunity for the scientiﬁc community to use/test/build\\non our work.\\n2 Background and Related Work\\nOpen-domain QA systems (Yang et al., 2015;\\nKwiatkowski et al., 2019) generally have a two-\\nstage pipeline: passage retrieval (i.e., ﬁnding rele-\\nvant text chunks related to an input question from\\na knowledge base) and machine comprehension\\n(i.e., generating an answer from a set of selected\\ndocuments). Traditionally sparse vector methods\\nsuch as TF-IDF and BM25 are used for document\\nretrieval (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). Re-\\nsearchers have recently moved to use dense text\\nrepresentations, which allows modeling textual sim-\\nilarity more semantic level. A recent example is the\\n‘Dense Passage Retriever (DPR)’ (Karpukhin et al.,\\n2020), which generates embeddings for questions\\nand text passages using two BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018) models. The dot product of the embeddings\\nis used as a similarity score between a question\\nand a passage. DPR has demonstrated that higher\\nretrieval precision results in a higher end-to-end\\nQA accuracy. For the answer generation compo-\\nnent of QA systems, recent studies have used either\\nextractive language models like BERT or genera-\\ntive language models like BART/GPT-2 (Min et al.,\\n2021; Lewis et al., 2021).\\n2.1 Retrieval Augmented Architecture\\nRecently, Retrieval Augmented Architectures\\n(Lewis et al., 2020b; Guu et al., 2020) have drawn\\na lot of attention due to their explainable, scalable,\\nand adaptable nature.

              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/RAG.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='QA architectures, RAG (Lewis et al., 2020b) com-\\nbines the information retrieval stage and answer\\ngeneration stage in a differentiable manner. It uses\\na combination of parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory, where the parametric memory consists of\\na pre-trained seq2seq BART (Lewis et al., 2019)\\ngenerator, and the non-parametric memory consists\\nof dense vector representations of Wikipedia arti-\\ncles indexed with the FAISS library (Johnson et al.,\\n2017). RAG ﬁrst encodes a question into a dense\\nrepresentation, retrieves the relevant passages from\\nan indexed Wikipedia knowledge base, and then\\nfeeds them into the generator. The loss function\\ncan ﬁnetune both the generator and the question en-\\ncoder at the same time. Lewis et al. (Lewis et al.,\\n2020b) highlight RAG’s ability to perform well\\nin Wikipedia-based general question-answering\\ndatasets like Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al.,\\n2019). Other recent work also highlights how the\\noutputs generated from RAG models are much\\nmore factual due to RAG being conditioned on\\nthe retrieved documents, possibly providing an an-\\nswer to the hallucination problem of generative\\nlanguage models. Shuster, Kurt, et al. (Shuster\\net al., 2021) also highlight how RAG reduces hal-\\nlucinations in knowledge-grounded conversational\\ntasks, where the task is to generate responses to\\ndialogues based on a large Wikipedia knowledge\\nbase. Xu et al. (2021) illustrate the effectiveness\\nof RAG in chat-bot frameworks and highlight how\\nRAG models are able to recall and summarize con-\\nversations compared to standard seq2seq models\\nwith only parametric memory. This paper aims\\nto understand how RAG could be extended to an\\nend2end model and adapted to speciﬁc domains.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time\\nRAG is being investigated on domain adaptation\\nfor the task of ODQA systems.\\n2.2 REALM-like end2end Retrieval Augment\\nArchitectures\\nREALM (Guu et al., 2020) is a similar Retrieval\\nAugmented model to RAG. REALM introduced\\na novel masked language pre-training step that in-\\nvolves an end-to-end trainable retriever. In the\\nREALM work, the authors ﬁrst train the entire\\nmodel on the masked language prediction task\\nand then ﬁne-tune it on question-answering tasks\\n(keeping the retriever frozen). In comparison to\\nREALM, the original RAG model uses an already\\ntrained DPR retriever and conducts partial end-to-end training with a BART reader model. Com-\\npared to REALM, RAG is less computationally\\nexpensive, and its code is available open-source.\\nWe explore and extend the original RAG archi-\\ntecture for domain adaptation in our work. We\\nadapted some concepts of our RAG-end2end ex-\\ntension from REALM. REALM only updates its\\nretriever during the pre-training process that uses\\nthe masked language modeling (MLM) (Devlin\\net al., 2018) task. Then during the downstream\\nﬁne-tuning task, REALM keeps its retriever ﬁxed.\\nHowever, the REALM end-to-end training code\\nis not open-sourced, possibly due to its computa-\\ntional complexity. Compared to REALM, RAG\\nis a combination of already pre-trained language\\nmodels where the users do not need to go through a\\nheavy pre-training stage. Due to these engineering-\\nfriendly features and high availability, we con-\\nducted our experiments with RAG and extended\\nRAG into an end-to-end trainable retrieval augmen-\\ntation model. It is also important to highlight that\\nnone of the prior work has explored the domain\\nadaptation of retrieval augment models for question\\nanswering; instead, most focus on general question\\nanswering with Wikipedia-based knowledge bases.\\nSimilar to REALM’s end2end architecture, re-\\ncent work (Sachan et al., 2021) extended RAG\\nand highlighted that the retriever training could\\nimprove the overall performance in question-\\nanswering datasets like Natural Questions. Com-\\npared to our work, the authors did not focus on\\nthe domain adaptation of retrieval augment mod-\\nels. The authors mainly explore the ability to train\\nneural retrievers in an end-to-end way using re-\\ntrieval augment models. Similarly, another related\\nwork (Singh et al., 2021) extended retrieval aug-\\nmented architectures to an end-to-end model and\\nillustrated that it could improve the question an-\\nswering accuracy. Singh et al. (2021) mainly fo-\\ncused on improving the document reading ability\\nand answer generation rather than domain adapta-\\ntion.\\n3 Model Architecture and Training\\nProcedure\\nIn this work, we extend RAG to ﬁnetune all compo-\\nnents, including the DPR retriever, and dynamically\\nupdate the external knowledge base during train-\\ning.

The input to the BART reader is illustrated\\nin Equation 3, where the model can differentiate the answer generation task and statement reconstruction\\ntask with the use of a control token. During the training, embeddings and the knowledge base index get\\nupdated asynchronously.\\nthe following sections, we describe our extensions\\nand training signals.\\n3.1 RAG Retriever and Generator\\nThe retriever is a DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020)\\nmodel pre-trained on Wikipedia-based question-\\nanswering datasets (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Joshi\\net al., 2017). It consists of two tower BERT-based\\nnetworks: the Question Encoder ( EQ) and the Pas-\\nsage Encoder ( EP). We use their CLS token embed-\\ndings as representations for questions and passages.\\nThe similarity between a question ( q) and a passage\\n(p) is calculated by taking the dot product of the\\ntwo embeddings as shown in Equation 1.\\nsim(p,q)∝EQ(q)TEP(p). (1)\\nRAG’s generator consists of a pre-trained\\nBART (Lewis et al., 2019) seq2seq language\\nmodel. To train these retriever and generator com-\\nponents, RAG enhances the traditional sequence-\\nto-sequence cross-entropy loss function by setting\\nthe retrieved passages as a latent variable ( Z) (Guu\\net al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020b). The loss value\\nof generating each token is marginalized on the\\nprobability of selecting documents given a context\\nX(i.e., Document Score p(Z|X)). The formula\\n(RAG-Token-Loss) can be written as illustrated in\\nEquation 2.PRAG−Token−Loss(y|x) =\\nn\\n∏\\ni∑\\nzεtop−kP(.|x)Pη(z|x)Pθ(yi|x,z,y1:i−1)(2)\\n3.2 Indexing of the External Knowledge Base\\nBefore the training phase, we need to encode all\\npassages in the external knowledge base using EP.\\nThen we need to retrieve similar passages from\\nthe external knowledge base given the output from\\nEQ. This process mainly involves dot product cal-\\nculation between input question embeddings and\\nencoded passages. The retrieval process will likely\\nresult in a performance bottleneck during the train-\\ning since there are usually millions of passages in\\nthe knowledge base. To address this issue, RAG\\nadopts the FAISS indexing approach proposed in\\n(Johnson et al., 2017). With the help of the indexes,\\nwe can skip a considerable amount of repeated com-\\nputation and signiﬁcantly accelerate the retrieval\\nprocess.\\n3.3 End-to-End Retriever Training\\nAlthough the DPR module makes use of two BERT\\nmodels ( EP,Eq), the original RAG architecture only\\nﬁne-tunes the question encoder EQin the retriever.\\nThe passage encoder EPand the external knowl-\\nedge base’s encoding are ﬁxed during the training'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/RAG.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='phase. In other words, the pre-trained passage en-\\ncoder of DPR is only used once to encode the ex-\\nternal knowledge base. The RAG authors suggest\\nthat such a design performs well for Wikipedia-\\nbased ODQA datasets (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019;\\nJoshi et al., 2017). Such settings work because the\\nDPR model was also pre-trained with Wikipedia-\\nbased datasets, and their experiment uses an exter-\\nnal knowledge base consisting of Wikipedia arti-\\ncles.\\nHowever, it may be beneﬁcial to ﬁne-tune all the\\nDPR components during RAG training for domain\\nadaptation since the model needs access to differ-\\nent domain-speciﬁc external knowledge bases. In\\nthis work, we introduce RAG-end2end , where we\\naugment RAG to be fully end-to-end trainable. We\\nﬁne-tune the passage encoder and question encoder\\nand then update the index of the external knowl-\\nedge base during the training process.\\nIt is straightforward to propagate gradients to\\nboth the passage and question encoders with RAG’s\\nloss function. Because this loss function employs\\nthe passage selection probability known as doc-\\nscore( pη(z|x)term illustrated in Equation 2). How-\\never, for it to have a true effect on the overall model\\ntraining process, we have to iteratively update the\\nembeddings with the updated context encoder and\\nthen update the index of the external knowledge\\nbase. In other words, we need to re-encode and\\nre-index the knowledge base using the updated\\npassage encoder. When the external knowledge\\nbase possesses tens of millions of passages, the re-\\nencoding and re-indexing steps can be very time-\\nconsuming. Re-encoding can take several GPU\\nhours, and re-indexing with FAISS can take several\\nCPU hours, depending on the size of the knowledge\\nbase. Therefore, it is inefﬁcient to stall the training\\nloop while the re-encoding re-indexing steps are\\nbeing carried out.\\nTo have an efﬁcient training mechanism, we de-\\nsigned our training framework into three main pro-\\ncesses: (1) The main training loop, which updates\\nthe gradients, (2) Re-encoding processes with sev-\\neral GPUs that update the knowledge-base encod-\\ning with the updated DPR’s context encoder, and\\n(3) A Re-indexing process that uses FAISS to build\\nan index with the updated encoding. Figure 1 illus-\\ntrates these three processes. Our implementation\\nuses two asynchronous processes to re-encode and\\nre-index the external knowledge base that runs in-\\ndependently to the main training loop. We ﬁrstdistribute the external knowledge base to a set of\\nGPUs that are not used in the main training loop.\\nThen we encode the passages with an updated pas-\\nsage encoder which we call the re-encoding pro-\\ncess. Once the re-encoding process has ﬁnished,\\nwe re-index the knowledge base in another paral-\\nlel process that uses FAISS (re-indexing process).\\nInside the main training loop, we ensure that the\\nre-indexing process always starts after ﬁnishing\\nthe re-encoding process. Then as soon as the new\\nindex of the external knowledge base is created,\\nwe load that to the main training loop. Once the\\nnew index loading is completed again, we start the\\nre-encoding process, which repeats the entire em-\\nbedding updating process. It is important to note\\nthat the ﬁrst re-encoding process should get ﬁn-\\nished, and new embeddings should get saved to the\\nhard disk before the start of the FAISS indexing pro-\\ncess. If the knowledge base is not entirely updated\\nwith the new embeddings, the re-indexing process\\nfails. We use python multiprocessing handles to\\nkeep the order, and re-indexing and re-encoding\\nprocesses are only asynchronous with respect to\\nthe main training loop process. The number of\\nsteps between each re-encoding process depends\\non the size of the dataset. To test the number of\\nsteps between the knowledge-base updates, we ex-\\nperimented with a knowledge base consisting of\\n250,000 passages and used four dedicated GPUs\\nfor the re-encoding process with a batch size of\\n32 each. Our computation machine consists of 96\\nCPU cores. We found that it takes an average of\\n750 updates. However, the computation time can\\nbe easily improved when using more GPUs for en-\\ncoding and using a machine with a higher number\\nof CPU cores (FAISS indexing process depends\\non the number of CPU cores). These steps are\\nrepeated throughout the training loop. Since the\\ntraining and knowledge base’s index update pro-\\ncesses are running asynchronously, it may result\\nin stale gradients. This, however, does not signiﬁ-\\ncantly degrade the model performance according\\nto previous research (Guu et al., 2020).\\n3.4 Statement Reconstruction\\nWe explore the incorporation of statement recon-\\nstruction as an auxiliary signal assuming that it\\nforces the model to gain more domain-speciﬁc\\nknowledge. As illustrated in Figure 1, we ﬁrst\\nencode input statements using the input/question\\nencoder ( EQ). Then the retriever retrieves the most'),\n",

We ensure that\\nthe external knowledge base does not contain the\\ninput statement to prevent the model from overﬁt-\\nting on just the lexical content. To differentiate\\nthe paraphrasing signal from the QA signal, we\\nprepend a special token <p>(represents pas-\\nsages) in front of the reconstruction statements,\\nwhich acts as a control token in the seq2seq lan-\\nguage modeling (Raffel et al., 2019; Keskar et al.,\\n2019).

As mentioned in the\\nrecent work (Lewis et al., 2020b), most ODQA\\ndatasets like Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al.,\\n2019) , TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), WebQues-\\ntions (Berant et al., 2013), and CuratedTrec (Baudiš\\nand Šediv `y, 2015) are answered with Wikipedia-\\nbased knowledge-bases. Since neural retrievers\\nlike DPR are already trained with Wikipedia-based\\ndatasets, it is hard for us to explore the domain\\nadaptation of RAG fairly in this setting. There-\\nfore, we selected three domain-speciﬁc datasets for\\nour experiment: COVID-19 QA, News QA, and\\nConversation QA. Since the availability of domain-\\nspeciﬁc ODQA datasets is minimal, in our work,\\nwe open-source all domain-speciﬁc knowledge-\\nbases and question-answer pairs to support future\\nresearch3.\\nCOVID-19 QA Domain\\nKnowledge Base Generation: To create the external\\nknowledge base, we use 5,000 full-text scientiﬁc\\narticles extracted from the CORD-19 (Wang et al.,\\n2020) dataset. The external knowledge base is\\ncreated with 250,000 100-word passages. Each\\n3domain speciﬁc datasetspassage is pre-pended with the title of the research\\npaper.\\nReconstruction Statement Generation: We use sen-\\ntences from the abstract section of research articles\\nfor the reconstruction signal. We ﬁrst extract the\\nabstract sections in 10K papers and split them into\\nsentences using the NLTK library (Loper and Bird,\\n2002). We ﬁlter out the sentences that are too short\\n(less than 15 words) or too long (more than 35\\nwords). In this process, approximately 50,000 ab-\\nstract statements are generated. It is important to\\nnote that when generating the knowledge base, we\\nexclude the abstract sections.\\nSynthetic QA Generation: In this domain, we only\\nuse synthetic data for training and validation. Fol-\\nlowing the prior work (Shakeri et al., 2020), we\\nuse a BART seq2seq model trained on the SQuAD\\ndataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) to generate syn-\\nthetic QA pairs given a passage. We used the Squad\\ndataset’s passages as the input and corresponding\\nquestion-answer pairs as the expected output. We\\ntrained a BART-large checkpoint for two epochs.\\nThen, we followed round-trip consistency (Alberti\\net al., 2019) to ﬁlter synthetic QA pairs. Our ﬁnal\\nsynthesized QA dataset consisted of 225,000 QA\\npairs. We use 90% of these QA pairs as training\\ndata and 10% as validation data.

This improvement in the EM score\\nranged from 0.84 points in the COVID-19 domain\\nand 3.12 points in the Conversation domain.\\nFinally, we highlight the overall improvement\\nof our contributions by comparing RAG-Original-\\nQA with RAG-end2end-QA +R. As the most sig-\\nniﬁcant improvement; we highlight the 13-point\\nimprovement of EM score for the Conversation do-\\nmain. For retrieval performance, we highlight the\\n27-point improvement in the top 5 and 16 improve-\\nments in the top 20 for the Conversation domain.\\nTo demonstrate the reconstruction statement gen-\\neration, we provide an example of the generated\\nreconstruction output of given a statement for each\\ndomain using the RAG-end2end-QAR +R model\\nin Table 2. The second column contains the in-\\nput statements with the special token <p>, the\\nthird column shows a snapshot of retrieved top-\\n5 documents, and the ﬁnal column shows the re-\\nconstructed statements.

We argue,\\nbased on our above-mentioned RAG end2end’s\\nretriever performances and prior work, that when\\nadapting RAG to various domains, having a\\ndomain-speciﬁc retriever plays a key role in achiev-\\ning good performance. However, this end-to-end\\nRAG ﬁnetuning can get computationally costly,\\nespecially with the number of passages in the\\nexternal knowledge base where they should get\\nre-encoded and re-indexed. Instead of ﬁnetuning\\nDPR as a part of RAG-end2end, an alternative\\napproach is to ﬁnetune DPR on domain-speciﬁc\\ndata separately on its vector similarity-based\\nloss function (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and then\\ninitializing the RAG architecture prior to ﬁnetuning\\nwith the QA data. We explore if RAG-end2end\\ncan perform on par if we initialize a RAG model'),\n",

We use the deep-haystack framework7\\nto ﬁnetune DPR for each domain using domain-\\nspeciﬁc data. We created ﬁnetuning datasets for\\nall three domains. First, for the Covid-19 do-\\nmain, we utilized the synthetic question-answer\\npairs and their relevant passages that consist of\\n100 words. The use of domain-speciﬁc synthetic\\nQA pairs for DPR ﬁnetuning has already shown\\npermanence improvements (Ma et al., 2020).

It is clear that RAG-end2end training improves\\nthe results since it can update the embeddings and\\nthe indexing of the knowledge base. Compared\\nwith the original RAG ﬁnetuning, RAG-end2end\\nimproves the performance in all datasets. The main\\nreason for this could be that neural retrievers such\\nas DPR, which are trained on public datasets, strug-\\ngle to perform well on domain-speciﬁc datasets.\\nOur results also highlight an important aspect re-\\nlated to the performance of the stand-alone DPR\\nfor document retrieval. It shows that RAG-end2end\\ncan improve the domain adaptation of DPR better\\nthat ﬁnetuning the DPR on its own mechanism.5.2 Cost of end2end retriever adaptation\\nIt is important to note that RAG-end2end ﬁne tun-\\ning can be expensive if the number of passages in\\nthe external knowledge base is large. If there are\\nmillions of passages, it would be beneﬁcial to have\\na dedicated number of GPUs that complete the re-\\nencoding process. Re-indexing with the FAISS\\nlibrary also depends on the number of cores in the\\nCPUs. When having access to strong enough com-\\nputational power, it is better to use RAG-end2end\\nsince we can directly use passages in a knowledge\\nbase and question-answer pairs to train both the\\nretriever and the reader. Then we also do not need\\nto generate synthetic question-answer pairs related\\nto passages that are required to train the DPR.\\nAlthough the RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2021)\\nauthors claim that frozen BERT embedding is suf-\\nﬁcient for retrieval augmented models, our results\\nsuggest that for domain-speciﬁc models to per-\\nform well, a domain-adapted retriever component\\nis beneﬁcial. In future work, it is important to ex-\\nplore how the models like RETRO (Borgeaud et al.,\\n2021) perform on domain-speciﬁc scenarios going\\nbeyond general-purpose datasets.\\n5.3 Comparing the RAG-original with\\nRAG-end2end on an In-domain dataset\\nModel Name EM F1 Top-5 Top-20\\nSQUAD Open-Domain\\n(1) RAG-original 28.12 39.42 59.64 72.38\\n(2) RAG-end2end 40.02 52.63 75.79 85.57\\nTable 5: Open-Domain performance comparison\\nbetween RAG-original and RAG-end2end.

First, we\\nextracted the contexts related to each question-\\nanswer pair and created an external knowledge\\nbase. Then we split the knowledge base into 100-\\nwords passages.

              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/RAG.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='we compared the performance of RAG-original\\nandRAG-end2end on the tasks of answer gener-\\nation and retrieving correct documents. As the\\nresults suggested, RAG-end2end performs better\\nthan RAG-original even in other Wikipedia-based\\ndatasets. This could be due to RAG-end2end updat-\\ning the context encoder and embeddings during the\\ntraining process.\\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel extension of\\nRAG: RAG-end2end , which, unlike RAG, does\\njoint training of the retriever and generator for the\\nend QA task and domain adaptation. We showed\\nthat the RAG-end2end could improve DPR perfor-\\nmance better than ﬁne-tuning the DPR indepen-\\ndently. This allows for the training of DPR models\\nwith QA pairs and eliminates the need for gold-\\nstandard passages related to questions. We also\\nhighlighted that the addition of a re-construction\\nauxiliary signal further improves both the retriever\\nand the ﬁnal answer generation accuracies. We\\nevaluate our approach with three datasets from dif-\\nferent domains (COVID-19, News, and Conversa-\\ntions), showing that RAG-end2end achieves signif-\\nicant performance improvements in all three do-\\nmains compared to the original RAG implementa-\\ntion. In addition, we conducted several other exper-\\niments to validate our approach comprehensively.\\nOverall, our results show that our approach is stable\\nand generalizable across different domains. Our\\nexperiments highlight the importance of the RAG’s\\nretriever component in domain-speciﬁc question\\nanswering.\\nBased on our ﬁndings, we suggest three di-\\nrections for future research in domain adaptation\\nof RAG Models. Firstly, we consider it worth-\\nwhile to explore RAG-end2end on other tasks like\\nFact Checking (Lewis et al., 2020b), Summarisa-\\ntion (Shuster et al., 2021), and conversational re-\\nsponse generation (Xu et al., 2021) where the orig-\\ninal RAG has shown interesting results. Secondly,\\nit is important to explore generative capabilities\\nwith qualitative metrics. This could be aligned\\nwith research areas like measuring factual consis-\\ntency (Kry ´sci´nski et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2022)\\nand hallucinations (Cao et al., 2022; Shuster et al.,\\n2021; Nie et al., 2019) of generative language mod-\\nels. Future work could explore whether updat-\\ning the retriever and document embeddings during\\nthe training phase could improve factual consis-tency and reduce hallucinations in ﬁnal generations.\\nThirdly, the improvement of RAG with our exten-\\nsion ( RAG-end2end ) highlights the importance of\\nthe retriever in the RAG architecture, which mo-\\ntivates us to improve the retriever part further in\\nfuture work. Also, as the statement re-construction\\nsignal acts as a good auxiliary signal, we encour-\\nage exploring other auxiliary signals, which could\\nimprove the overall performance of RAG models.\\nReferences\\nChris Alberti, Daniel Andor, Emily Pitler, Jacob\\nDevlin, and Michael Collins. 2019.

As an easy example, on the National Mall, \\nthere is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the Lincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James version of the Bible. The \\nnation commemorates and acknowledges Lincoln and what he has said. But by individual will be engaged in a -- in a situation \\nwhere they will be endangered. And I think that was certainly true of William Lloyd in the Totten case. When he crossed southern \\nlines, he was very much endangered, and that's something that wasn't lost on President Lincoln. In footnote 3 of our opening \\nbrief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the need for secrecy to \\nprotect that. So that's why I think that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not being required \\nindividual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where they will be endangered.

So that's why I \\nthink that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not being required with President Lincoln to \\nengage in espionage activities in the south. And this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr. Lloyd came to seek \\ncompensation from a court, that there was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement, and the remedy, if any, lay with \\nthe President's contingent fund. <end> JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I'd like your help on this.
